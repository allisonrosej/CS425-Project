# CS 426 Final Project Spring 2023
> By: Emanuel Nunez, Zachary Slate, Leo Galang and Allison Johnson

## Muscaria
> Muscaria is a 2D pixel platformer with a metroidvania-style game that is lightly inspired by the game "Hollow Knight" and "Celeste". Muscaria is being developed by the Unity game engine. The game will be family-friendly, meaning any age group will be able to play it.

## Storyline
> Muscaria's storyline mainly takes place within a complex cave system that is engulfed with 'monsters'. It is almost forbidden to enter the caves because of how dangerous it is. Unfortunately, the main character's little brother has caught a rare and lethal disease that can only be cured by the muscaria mushroom. The mushroom can only be found deep within cave systems, so the sister must go on an adventure to fight off monsters, find the mushroom, and return it to her brother before his demise. 

## Mechanics 
> Muscaria has multiple mechanics that are necessary for our main character to navigate the cave system. Mechanics includes dashing, jumping, double jumping, wall jumping, wall sliding, and attacking. These mechanics will allow the player to defend herself and also traverse the cave system with a slight challenge.

## Scripts 
> There is a script folder in the assets folder broken down into folders for each team member's scripts.
